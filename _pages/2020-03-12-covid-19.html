<p>Due to the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/action.html#faith">updated recommendations</a> from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), IGDA Twin Cities will be suspending our <strong>in person</strong> meetings through April. Given the ever changing nature of the situation, this suspension may be extended as necessary to protect the members of our community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, we realize that during times like this, connection is vital to the health and well-being of our community members. As such, we will be holding virtual events during our usual meeting times, as well as engaging with you via Slack and Discord. If you are not currently a member of the <a href="https://mspgamedev.slack.com/">MSP Game Dev Slack</a>, you may request an invitation to join <a href="https://mspgamedevslack.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. To join the IGDA parent organization’s Discord, please go <a href="https://discord.gg/igda">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please bear with us as we work out the logistics of moving to an all virtual format. We will continue to monitor the situation, and give updates as frequently as possible. If you have any questions or concerns you want to bring to the board, please do not hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:igdatwincities@gmail.com">igdatwincities@gmail.com</a>. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
