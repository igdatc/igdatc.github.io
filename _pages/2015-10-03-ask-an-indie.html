<p><strong>What inspired you to start making games?</strong><br />
I have to say every type of art I enjoy I make, but it wasn’t true until Shanti approached me about moving from professional theatre to game development. As to what really inspired me it would have to be my lifelong love of games. They’ve always been a part of my life and I can’t imagine myself without them.</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to start making games?</strong></p>
<p>Playing games is what initially got me interested in their production. I clearly remember playing a Star Trek arcade machine in a bowling alley when I was about 13. The game was so amazing, I was mesmerized by it. I didn’t know what it took to make a game or that it was even an actual career, but I thought, “I have to figure out a way to do this.”</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to start making games?</strong></p>
<p>This is the question every indie dev loves to answer! I’ve been into video games ever since I was a little kid. The SNES was my bread and butter, and I have very fond memories of playing Final Fantasy III and Mega Man 7. My all-time favorite game series is Mega Man, and it really impressed on me what a game should feel like when you play it. The responsiveness of the controls and the way the character moves… all of it comes together in the Mega Man games to create a fun, action-packed experience.<br />
That’s something I’d like to capture in my future games.</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to start making games?</strong></p>
<p>I played a ton of games as a kid, and I found myself having ideas about how those games could work differently. I also spent hours and hours drawing things as a kid. I’d imagine things inspired by cartoons or whatever, and then I’d draw them out. I think I liked the process of creation. Games ended up being the same for me. I remember spending a lot of time with a pencil and graph paper drawing out my own levels for different games.</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to start making games?</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, I’ve been making video games for almost 20 years. Other than a fun, interactive historical game starring Joan of Arc that I created for a high school project, most of my early games have never been shown to the public.</p>
<p>Games are a unique medium in that they bring together visuals, audio, and tactile feedback, and it’s actually quite an undertaking to put all the pieces together in a cohesive way. I dabble in art and music, and my training as a software engineer made the transition to making games professionally a natural fit.</p>

<p>I think it differs for all of us, just as our backgrounds and many of the games we’re interested in differ. I have personally wanted to do this since I was in high school “way back” in the 90’s. I think for a couple of us, the idea of actually making games was merely an extension to how much we loved this industry and medium.</p>
