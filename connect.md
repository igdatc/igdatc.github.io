#### [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/igda-tc) (Archived)

In the past, the IGDA Twin Cities has maintained a mailing list, which eventually we migrated to [a google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/igda-tc). You can still view the google group posts, but both have been disabled in favor of the communication methods above.
