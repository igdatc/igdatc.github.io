IGDATC wants you to feel safe and to be safe at our events and operates the following Safe Spaces Policy. The most important thing we want you to know is that if something or someone makes you feel uncomfortable at one of our events, no matter how minor it seems, you can report it to us.

Harassment of event participants, staff or volunteers at IGDATC events will not be tolerated and anyone violating this policy at our events may be be expelled.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or attitudes related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the event, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Please know that the IGDATC team views neither ignorance nor intoxication as an excuse for unacceptable behavior.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior towards you, the IGDATC team will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you feel you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the IGDATC team.

The IGDATC team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

Whilst we would like to feel that we offer an environment in which you can voice concerns about incidents as and when they happen we also welcome you to reach out to us to inform us of past harassment or incidents related to our events which made you feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

IGDATC also accepts that we are not above our own policies so please know all of the above applies to all members of our team in equal measure. We believe in protecting radical and free self-expression in the artwork that we showcase, however it is the utmost priority to us that our attendees feel safe and that we create a safe space in which to experience the work we curate.

You can reach us at igdatc@igdatc.org. All communication related to this policy will be dealt with in confidence.
