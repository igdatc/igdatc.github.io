<p><strong>Holiday Hootenanny</strong><strong>!</strong></p>
<p>Come to Grumpy's downtown and play some games with us! We'll have Sports Friends, and various tabletop games, as well as whatever YOU bring to play. We'll be getting kicked out of our room around 9, but we can hang out in the bar and shoot pool as long as we want.</p>
<p>Show up on time, because happy hour only goes until 7.</p>
