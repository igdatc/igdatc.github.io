<h3>A special Halloween Board Game Multiplayer Extravaganza at Light Grey Art Lab!</h3>
<p>IGDA Twin Cities is proud to present another Multiplayer Extravaganza on Wednesday, October 29th.</p>
<p>This month we are teaming up with Light Grey Art Lab, and joining them for <a href="blog.lightgreyartlab.com/2014/10/light-grey-game-night-fright-night.html">tabletop games</a> in their gallery space. This means we won't have the usual projectors and controllers, sorry if that disappoints you!</p>
<p>As usual, we're coordinating with a number of local game developers and hope to have an awesome selection of local board games to play! Usually we're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers, but this time around we won't have as much space. Your board game can be a rough demo or a finished product. If you'd like to show your game, please select the "I'll attend and want to bring a game I made!" ticket type when registering for the event.</p>
<p>The Multiplayer Extravaganza is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local creators bring to the events. Come share your passion for games, or sign up to show your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world. </p>
<p>All of our events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
