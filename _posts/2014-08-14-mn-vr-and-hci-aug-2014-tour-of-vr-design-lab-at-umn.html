<p>Phil Rader and Aaron Westre from the UMN College of Design will be giving us a tour of the <a href="http://vr.design.umn.edu/" rel="nofollow">VRDL (Virtual Reality Design Lab)</a>, and a presentation on the project with all the technical details involved.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">The VRDL simultaneously tracks 6 to 8 people in a 50ft square space.  This required development of a lightweight and untethered HMD called Perception that is based on iPad Minis and 3D printed shells.<a style="color: #ee6600;" href="http://vr.design.umn.edu/technology/" rel="nofollow">More tech details.</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The VR demo will be about 5-10 minutes per person, and the majority of the meeting will be spent learning about the applications for this space, hardware and software used, asset pipeline, and general Q&amp;A.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The courtyard is in the center of the main/square portion of Rapson Hall. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan to arrive between 6 and 6:30, the doors lock at 7.</span>  The closest parking is the Church St garage.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The VRDL is an active and evolving laboratory and we are currently documenting its use for a variety of purposes from educational to promotional, photographs of visitors to the lab may be reproduced or published in a variety of forums and formats. If you do not wish for your photograph to be used, please let us know before your visit.</p>
