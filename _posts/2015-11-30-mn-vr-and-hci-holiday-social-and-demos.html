<p><strong>Space, snacks and soda generously provided by <a href="http://www.space150.com/" rel="nofollow">space150</a>  Please try to arrive at the 3rd Ave entrance between 6:30 and 7.  You'll be escorted to the elevator.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MN VR and HCI Holiday Social and Demos</strong></p>
<p>This is primarily a social event. But, we always like to show work!  Local devs and artists have confirmed 7 very unique demos so far, with some really fun bells and whistles. No matter how hardcore, I guarantee you haven't experienced even half of these. If you have, we really should hang out.</p>
<p>We'd love folks to bring more demos and show off work. Or, just some GearVRs to test the networked/social VR while in the same physical space!  Remember the tag line of MN VR and HCI: Anything interactive with weird input or output ...just not THAT weird. Portable is best, but there is a ramp from street level - please confirm ahead for heavy/large/crazy demos.</p>
<p><strong>Parking:</strong></p>
<p>There is nearby street parking and surface lots.  Ramp C is also close.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>

<p>We'll resume our normal schedule of every 4th Wed starting 1/27/16, with a VR dev bootcamp just before the Global Game Jam. Don't forget to mark your calendars for GGJ 2016 on 1/29-31, The holidays are also a great time to bank extra SO points before you're gone for a whole weekend!</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the Global Game Jam, here's <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/" rel="nofollow">info</a> and <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/history" rel="nofollow">history/stats</a>.  Our local site last year ended up with <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games" rel="nofollow">6 VR and HCI focused games</a>. Let's make more this year!</p>
