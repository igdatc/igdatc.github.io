<p><b><strong>GDC Recap</strong></b></p>
<p>It’s a few weeks after GDC and some talented, local game developes have volunteered to discuss some GDC topics. Additonally, if time permits, we will have an open forum for discussing some of the bigger news events. So bring your favorite stories from GDC - a favorite talk, demo, conversation, big announcement, experiences, hero sightings, questions, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>Main Presentation: Paths: A Druid’s Duel Post-mortem</strong></b></p>
<p>It’s no secret that game development involves a multitude of difficult decisions from game inception to final release. Every step you take alters your view and affects latter choices. Only upon review can we see the path for what it was and determine just how good (or bad) our decisions may have been.</p>
<p>Join Kris Szafranski for an honest review of the development and launch of <a href="http://www.druidsduel.com/">A Druid’s Duel</a>, a turn-based strategy game released on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/333970/">Steam</a> in February 2015.</p>
<p>In this talk we'll dissect the development and business decisions made and their outcomes around common game development concerns: Game Design, Architecture, Project Management, Marketing/PR, and Community Management.</p>
<p>Kris Szafranski is the owner of <a href="http://www.druidsduel.com/">Thoughtshelter Games</a>, where he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and then launched the game A Druid's Duel on Steam in early 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>Plug My Thing!</strong></b></p>
<p>In addition to informal verbal plugs, we'll also show your trailer, user group, recruitment page, promo video, demo reel, etc. Grab the appropriate ticket - first come, first served.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short and sweet. 3 minutes max!</li>
<li>1 short URL, Zero setup (Media is streamable from fast/reliable site like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)</li>
<li>Your Contact info is on page or in video.</li>
<li>You were a part of this project, are attending the meeting, and will introduce it.</li>
<li>Meet us in the auditorium at least 5-10 minutes early, so we can load your page.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>Agenda (approximate)</strong></b></p>
<p>6:00 Snacks and Soda (thanks to the Nerdery!) and socialize.</p>
<p>6:30 Meeting starts. Announcements and Plug My Thing!</p>
<p>6:45 Member Project</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll be heading to <a href="http://www.sensers.com/bloomington.html">Joe Sensers in Bloomington</a> after the event. Come socialize with other local developers.</p>
<p>Many, many thanks to <a href="http://nerdery.com/">The Nerdery</a> for hosting the <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/">IGDA Twin Cities</a> events over the years.</p>
