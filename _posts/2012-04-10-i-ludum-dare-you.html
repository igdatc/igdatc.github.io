<p>The event is coming soon. We all ready ourselves with collections of snacks and caffeinated beverages. Ludum Dare 22 is nearing.</p>
<p>On April 20th, thru the 23rd, we invite everyone to participate in the Ludum Dare game design competition. While we don't have a specific location I do plan on setting up an IRC chat channel for the weekend for us to chat in during the competition. The Ludum Dare is a single event, no teams, and you must start from scratch or use publicly available libraries.</p>
<p>You can learn more at:Â <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">http://ludumdare.com/compo/</a></p>
<p>Let us know in the comments if you will be taking part or join us on the IRC channel. The details for that will be coming in the next few days.</p>
