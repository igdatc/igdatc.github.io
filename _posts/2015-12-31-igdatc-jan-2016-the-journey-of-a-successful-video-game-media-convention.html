<p><b>Main Presentation: The Journey of a Successful Video Game Media Convention </b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/Gamer's%20Rhapsody">Gamer’s Rhapsody</a> is a video game convention held in Bloomington, MN. The second annual convention was in November 2015 and celebrated video games and their creation through live performances of video game music; panels and workshops. Thomas Spargo, founder of <a href="http://gamersrhapsody.com/">Gamer's Rhapsody</a> will talk about the convention, reviewing some of the aspects that were sucessful. Additionally, he will discuss the process of starting a business in Minnesota along with project management principles. Whether it's a game, an event, or a brand new business, a structured project management plan helps to keep any type of project on course and reaching milestones.<br />
Thomas is a recent Augsburg College graduate in marketing and business analytics. In college, he started <a href="http://gamersrhapsody.com/">Gamer's Rhapsody</a> video game convention taking place annually in the late fall along with a Knexus LLC, an event planning and consultation group. Thomas has been planning large scale events for over 6 years.</p>
