<p><a style="font-size: 1.5em;" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/org/751587541?s=18488983" target="_blank">Wednesday, October 23, 2013 from 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM (CDT)</a></p>
<div id="event_network">
<p>There is a great new generation of VR games thanks to the <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/vrjam/">VR Jam</a>, and ongoing community work.</p>
<p>Expect to do 5-10 ~5 minute sessions, and have a little vertigo inbetween. Wear contacts if you have them, everyone last time said it also works fine with no correction/glasses.</p>
<p>Kickoff is 7pm in the auditorium.  Setup is in the Nerdery classroom, lunchroom <strong>AND</strong> auditorium. (Hefty A/C, props and saftey bean bags to play <a href="https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=2915">Hydra Cover Shooter</a>)</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Rift Bringers </strong>- Bring an extension cord, lens cloth, and a Hydra if you have it.  We'd love to show your work!  Demos of other HCI hardware also welcome (Leap, Depth Cam, other HMDs, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Demo Minders</strong> - Lend a hand if you're good with PC/Mac video card / multimon, so that the nice folks sharing their hardware get to try everything.  We'll make sure you do too.  Arrive by 6:30 for setup.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail list - </strong>We're likely to "sell out" again.  But we will notify you of any cancelations, and future events.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
