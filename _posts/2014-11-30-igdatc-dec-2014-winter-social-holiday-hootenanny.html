<h3><strong>Winter Social / Holiday Hootenanny</strong></h3>
<p>December is a busy time for everyone, so our regular monthly meeting in December is replaced with a casual social event.  This year, come join us at <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/"><strong>Republic (Seven Corners)</strong></a> for good friends, games to play, and general fun!  The festivities begin at <strong>6:30pm on Wed, Dec 10</strong> and go late.  Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight!  The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.</p>
<p>Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public.  You are welcome and encouraged to bring friends, significant others, and strangers.  Come for dinner, have a beer or lemonade, play some games or just hang out.</p>
<h4>Local Games Screen</h4>
<p>As part of the game playing and socializing fun, we want to encourage local game makers to show off their own current projects.  Sign up for the <strong>"bring a game"</strong> ticket type, and we'll contact you with details.  This is a very friendly and helpful opportunity to do playtesting or just get general encouragement.</p>
<p>We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers.  Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a videogame, etc.</p>
<p><strong>See you at Republic for the fun!</strong></p>
