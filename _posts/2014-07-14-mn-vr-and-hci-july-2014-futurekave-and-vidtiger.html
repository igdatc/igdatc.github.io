<p>Wednesday, July 23, 2014 from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM (CDT)</p>
<h2><a href="http://igdatc.eventbrite.org">Please Register on Eventbrite</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.futurekave.com/">FutureKave</a> is an interactive 3D game experience that transports you to a realm of social play and possibility. Your body movement paints and sculpts the spinning moon beneath your avatar. What begins as a desolate moonscape is brought to colorful life as you move and interact with other players. FutureKave is a grand experiment at the intersection of art and technology, the real and the virtual.</p>
<p><a href="http://vidtiger.com/">VidTiger</a> has shown FutureKave at several venues and events, and recently as a part of <a href="http://2014.northernspark.org/project/vidtiger">Northern Spark</a>. Chuck Olsen, Maxwell Hoaglund and co. will give a broad presentation on the FutureKave project. Expect to hear about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept and iterations</li>
<li>Tech prototypes for character control</li>
<li>Integrating Kinect into Unity</li>
<li>How we track more than 2 people on Kinect 1</li>
<li>Lessons learned about setup, logistics and the audience</li>
</ul>
<p>...and of couse, live demos!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Schedule:</h4>

<h4>About MN VR and HCI</h4>
<p>MN VR and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) welcomes developers and tinkerers working with all variety of VR,  HCI, hardware hacking, creative coding and interactive art. Members are working projects with light field displays, mocap, tiny computers, servos and sensors, interactive statues and a variety of VR, motion and computer vision games.</p>
<p>If you've only been to our parent group IGDATC meetings, MN VR and HCI is a different format: We aim for group discussions and lots of specific details, have smaller meetings in the well-lit Nerdery classroom (off of the cafeteria), no pizza, but lots of soda.</p>
