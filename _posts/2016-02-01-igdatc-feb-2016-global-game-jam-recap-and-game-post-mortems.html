<p dir="ltr"><strong>Global Game Jam Recap and Game Post-mortems</strong></p>
<p>GameCraft, the Global Game Jam 2016, was a smashing success with <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/gamecraft-2016/games" rel="nofollow">31 games submitted on our jam site</a>. With the 2016 Global Gam Jam still fresh in our minds, come join us for a review discussion and post-mortems. Some teams will talk about their game and their jam expereince. What went wrong, what went right? Learned lessons and fun happenings. A great way to recap the Global Game Jam and see what eveyone spent their 48 hours on.</p>
