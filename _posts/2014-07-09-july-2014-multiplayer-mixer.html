<h3>Multiplayer Mixer!</h3>
<p>IGDA Twin Cities and <a href="http://glitch.mn/">Glitch</a> are excited to co-host the Multiplayer Mixer.</p>
<p>The Multiplayer Mixer is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local game makers bring to the events. Come share your passion for games, or sign up to show your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world.<br />
We're coordinating with a number of local game developers and will have an awesome selection of local games to play!<br />
Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
<p>All of our events are open to the public.</p>
<p>Note that BWW has a small attached parking lot, and street/ramp parking near by. Happy hour is until 6:30.</p>
