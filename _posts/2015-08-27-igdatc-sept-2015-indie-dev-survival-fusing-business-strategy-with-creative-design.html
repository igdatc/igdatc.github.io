<p><strong>Member Project: Composer Quest, Developer Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Charlie McCarron produces the podcast <a href="http://composerquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Composer Quest</a>. As part of the show, he regularly gives composing "quests" to create new music based on a specific challenge, like score a short film, write a song based on a fortune cookie, etc. The next quest hopes to connect composers and game developers and create short games based on a theme (TBD). The end goal will be a gallery of new games with original scores to show off at <a title="Gamer's Rhapsody" href="http://gamersrhapsody.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gamer's Rhapsody</a> on November 13-14th.</p>
<p>Charlie McCarron along with Thomas Spargo from <a title="Gamer's Rhapsody" href="http://gamersrhapsody.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gamer's Rhapsody</a>Â will present their quest challenge in more detail and discuss the idea with the audience.</p>

<p><strong>Main Presentation: Indie Dev Survival: Fusing Business Strategy with Creative Design</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows the Indie Bubble has collapsed and there is no hope of surviving as an Indie Dev. What this talk presupposes is: Maybe there is?</p>
<p>Patrick Swinnea (<a title="Omega Drive" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omega-drive/id434937881?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Omega Drive</a>, <a title="Merlin's Marble" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/merlins-marble/id513761904?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merlin's Marble</a>) looks back on six years as a one-man game studio... What worked, what didn't and how The Force Awakens could possibly be worse than the Prequels (j/k, it can't).</p>
<p>Topics include monetization, discoverability, development tools, humorous (angry) fan mail and thoughts on the future of solo game development as a business endeavor.<br />
<strong>Plug My Thing!</strong></p>
<p>In addition to informal verbal plugs, we'll also show your trailer, user group, recruitment page, promo video, demo reel, etc. Grab the appropriate ticket - first come, first served.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short and sweet. 3 minutes max!</li>
