<h3><strong>About Multiplayer Extravaganza</strong></h3>
<p><em>Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public.  All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).</em></p>
<p>Our community gets together monthly(ish) at a bar to play games and share gaming experiences at Multiplayer Extravaganza. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of multiplayer favorites suggested by the community as well as <strong>locally made games</strong> that local creators bring to the events. <strong>It's kind of like playing games on a couch with your friends, but bigger!</strong></p>
<h3>October Games!</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Crawl4-300x169.png" alt="Crawl4" width="280" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-552" /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/arena_gods_screenshot_1080p_2-300x169.png" alt="arena_gods_screenshot_1080p_2" width="280" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-553" /></p>
<p>We will try to show some spooky stuff to get you in the mood for Halloween.  Games shown will include the creeptastic multiplayer game <a href="http://www.powerhoof.com/crawl/">Crawl</a> and Loren Schmidt's <a href="http://lorenschmidt.itch.io/murder-simulator-v-666">Murder Simulator v.666</a> which is a 2d arena deathmatch game with antigravity instead of jumping and a huge variety of unique weapons.  We will also be testing an alpha build of <a href="http://supertypegames.com/sheet.php?p=arena_gods">Arena Gods</a> by Supertype.  It's kind of like a top down 4-player Nidhogg with flying swords.</p>
<h3>Locally Made Games</h3>
<p>We want to encourage local game makers to show off their own current projects.  Sign up for the <strong>"bring a game"</strong> ticket type, and we'll contact you with details.  This is a very friendly and helpful opportunity to do playtesting or just get general encouragement.</p>
<p>We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers.  Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a videogame, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>See you at Republic!</strong></h3>
<p>Join us at <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/">Republic (Seven Corners)</a> for an awesome time!  The festivities begin at <strong>6:30pm on Thursday, October 8th</strong> and go late.  Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight!  The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.</p>
<p>More info and further discussion can be found on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/igda-tc">IGDA-TC google group</a>.</p>
