<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4029059024"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">August Brown - Designing Great (or At Least Fun) Achievements in Video Games</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Xbox Live does it.  Steam does it.  Even PSN does it.  But does that mean that you should do it?  Probably, but we'll get into that later.</p>
<p>We've all played games with terrible achievements and we've probably all played a few with really good ones, but more and more it seems like they're a afterthought tacked on late in the development process.  This presentation will explore how achievements affect the user experience of a video game and how you can use achievements in your games to enrich the experience.</p>
<p>August Brown designs video game achievements professionally for <a href="http://kongregate.com/">kongregate.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member Project: Nate Yourchuck - Dr. Wordfield</strong></p>
<p>Nate Yourchuck will present Dr. Wordfield. This game combines the wordgames with friends genre and deckbuilding games such as Dominion and Ascension. It is available for intrepid playtesters at <a href="http://wordfield.com/">wordfield.com</a></p>
