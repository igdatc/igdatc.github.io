<a style="color: #ee6600;" href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032581951">https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032581951</a></div>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some event details and updates since our April IGDATC meeting:</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Breakfast and registration starts at 9.  The first session is 9:30.  Lunch is also provided.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Introduction to Unity session will be taught by J Marshall Pittman - who has an extensive background teaching Unity, art and animation pipelines.  <a style="color: #ee6600;" href="http://jmarshallpittman.com/">http://jmarshallpittman.com/</a><br />
(Unity is no longer sending someone, as was previously announced.)</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Unity Porting Lab is a working session aimed at intermediate/advanced Unity devs with an existing game.  You'll get hands-on help porting to Windows and Windows Phone, be able to test on a variety of devices, learn how BizSpark is being used for game development software and online hosting, and get signed up for free.<br />

<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements:</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Note that for the Porting Lab you need a PC running <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 8 or 8.1</span> (and Windows Pro if you want to try local device emulation.)  Mac users can get a Windows QuickStart kit (which will run Windows 8 pro on your Mac OSX via Parallels Desktop 9).</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the Introduction to Unity session, you can work on <span style="font-weight: bold;">any laptop</span> running Unity 4.3.3+ free or Pro.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Note: We have an Eventbrite invite which is how we have communicated events in the past, but the Eventbrite points to the Microsoft registration.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Consider joining the Google Group for more info and further discussion. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/igda-tc">IGDA-TC google group</a>.</p>
