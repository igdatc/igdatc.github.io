<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">A Homebrew Data Glove with Haptic Feedback on a Budget - Paul Christian</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">While I was anxiously waiting for my DK1 to ship, all I could think about were ways to do things in VR. Game controllers are great, but I wanted hands. So having a bit of electronics knowledge and being a decent programmer, I figured might as well try to build a data glove.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">This will be a brief presentation of what went into making it, some things learned in the process, applications, limitations and future plans; followed by a hands-on demo if time allows.  I'll also do an <span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">overview of features vs complexity and cost in commercial gloves/trackers.</span></span><br />
Paul Christian is a full-stack JVM web developer/artist/musician, and recent transplant from Philadelphia. Interested in collaboration or employment relating to VR, physical computing, HCI R&amp;D, edutainment, etc.<br />
