##### Optimizing Like it's 1999 - Scott Lembcke

As CPUs get faster, engineers add more buzzwords like superscalar execution, pipelining, cache hierarchies, and branch prediction. What do they all mean, and how do they affect performance? Can we still optimize code like it's 1999 or is there a better way now? How much of a difference can it make? Come and find out!


Scott Lembcke is the main author of Chipmunk Physics and a cofounder of Howling Moon Software. He has been pretending to write high performance code for over a decade.
