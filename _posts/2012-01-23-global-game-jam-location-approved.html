<p>We finally got our site approved by the people over at GGJ. You can now find it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2012/igda-twin-cities-igdatc" target="_blank">http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2012/igda-twin-cities-igdatc</a></p>
<p>Make sure to create an account on the Global Game Jam site and set the IGDA Twin Cities to your location. It appears that the final word on The Nerdery being open overnight on Saturday is still up in the air so make sure to stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>We are also asking everyone to be sure to fill our your profile on the GGJ site so we know all of the skill sets and abilities we have coming in. If you can do multiple things make sure to list them all.</p>
<p>That's all for now but I'm sure there will be more to come in the coming week as we lead into the GGJ.</p>
