<p>If you're paying attention, this might look like a duplicate meeting announcement. Due to a scheduling mistake, last month's main presenter was moved to this month.</p>
<p><b><strong>Music Theory for Devs: Basics for Non-Composers<br />
</strong></b>Troy Strand</p>
<p>Do you find yourself unable to express the musical ideas for your game? Want to save time and money when talking with your composer? Come listen to Troy Strand discuss the building blocks of music, helpful hints to get the exact sound you’re looking for, and how to communicate with the composer you’ve hired for your next big hit!.</p>
<p><b><strong>The Rift Between ZeniMax and Oculus, and What It Means for the Future<br />
</strong></b>Brent Lorentz</p>
<p>February’s jury decision ordering Oculus to pay half a billion dollars to game company ZeniMax finds developers, game executives and hardware designers wondering what could come next. Among charges of violating a non-disclosure agreement, misappropriating trade secrets, copyright infringement and other allegations, the lawsuit poses real implications for players in an industry that is as collaborative as it is secretive.</p>
<p>Join Brent Lorentz as he walks us through the details of the case, how the charges came about, and highlights how the case has the potential to significantly alter the VR gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Brent Lorentz is a litigation shareholder with Winthrop &amp; Weinstine, representing clients in complex litigation matters. He has a personal passion for the video game, game development and gaming industry, especially where it intersects with intellectual property and business law. He also frequently blogs about gaming topics and the law via Winthrop &amp; Weinstine’s award-winning <a href="http://www.duetsblog.com/">DuetsBlog</a>.</p>
