<p>On Thursday, August 6th, I took part in <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rally-cry-video-games-tickets-17771643464">an event</a> aimed at promoting and building the twin cities game development community. This was put on by an organization called <a href="https://pollenmidwest.org">Pollen</a>, and held at the new office space for <a href="http://glitch.mn/">Glitch</a>. My role was really just to give a brief overview of IGDA Twin Cities, and I had a ten minute slot to do that. I put together these slides for the event, but there wasn't room for a projector, so here they are.</p>
