<p><strong><a href="http://deeperarts.com/">Deeper Arts</a> - Barry McMahon</strong></p>
<p>Why didn't Superman prevent those planes from hitting the Twin Towers on 9/11?<br />
What do you do when Apple rejects your app for defamatory content?<br />
Do Aldotians only know how to say one thing, and if so, how do they communicate?</p>
<p>While these questions do burn within the mind, the answers are coming!<br />
Join Barry McMahon for a closer look at Deeper Arts and the story of how an artist and a neurologist<br />
decided to become developers.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Member Project: </strong><strong>PHWaD - Team Hard Work and Drudgery</strong></p>
<p>What do you get when you mix eight Computer Science students, one semester, and the desire to build one awesome video game? Learn of the trials and tribulations of these eight programmers, and discover the fruits of the valuable experience that is <strong>Project Hard Work and Drudgery!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Plug My Thing!</strong></p>
<p>We had a good idea (we think) and would like to see how it evolves.  In addition to the informal verbal plugs we do at the start of the meetings, We will also show your user group, recruitment page, promo video, demo reel, etc.  Grab the appropriate ticket, first come, first served.</p>
