<p><strong>Global Game Jam 2015 VR and HCI project post-mortems and interaction design discussion</strong></p>
<p>We had five(!) projects at the local 48-hour Global Game Jam with VR and/or unique HCI. Projects can be viewed and downloaded at <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games" rel="nofollow">http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games</a></p>
<p>We're going to do post-mortems on at least 4 of these projects: The focus will be on VR/HCI interaction design aspects of the project. We'll also be sharing lessons learned about workflow, debugging and tuning/playtest tips.</p>
<p>SmartThings is on the 3rd floor above The Bulldog NE. <strong> Go through the glass door and up 3 flights of stairs.  Please plan for traffic and parking so you can arrive before the door locks at 7</strong>, or we'll be running up and down those stairs a whole lot.  There is street and lot parking all around the building.  The nearest ramp is a block away by Ginger Hop.</p>
