<p><strong>Using zSpace for visualization at Boston Scientific<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Discussions and demos of how Boston Scientific is using zSpace systems for visualization and design.  The zSpace workstations let you view 3D object from multiple angles, and interact with them in 3D space above the screen.  The hardware is a combination of a unique 3D monitor, polarized glasses, head tracking and a 3D tracked stylus.</p>
<p>We'll also have a brief discussion on the upcoming Global Game Jam (Jan 23-25), and Oculus, PC Hardware, and other news.</p>
<p><strong>BSC is located off of Weaver Lake Rd, which is the next exit west after 494 and 694 merge into 94.</strong><strong>  Once you turn off of Weaver Lake Rd into BSC, continue on the ring road to the far end of the complex and park near the building 3 lobby.  Enter on the large parking lot side.</strong></p>
