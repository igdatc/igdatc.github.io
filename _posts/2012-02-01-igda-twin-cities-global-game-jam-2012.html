<p>Over the last weekend 25 local game developers converged on the Nerdery, taking hold of various tables and rooms for Global Game Jam 2012.  The theme was a snake biting its tail, the Ouroboros.  At then end of the 48 hour event, 10 games were released into the wild.  <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/global-game-jam-2012/">Details about the local games are here!</a></p>
<p>The IGDA Twin Cities chapter would like to extra-huge-mega thank <a href="http://nerdery.com/">The Nerdery</a> for providing the location for the entire 48 hour event, as well as provining internet, drinks, snacks, food and ample whiteboard space!  Thanks to the staff, Tom, Greg and Joe for volunteering to spend their weekend and nights with us.  The Nerdery, and its employees, are top notch in every aspect and we can't say thank you enough.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated. </p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to Zach Wendt for coordinating the event details and Ty Burks for helping drum up interest at the January meeting.</p>
<p>Our Feb meeting is already next week on 2/8 (event emails coming soon)!  IGDATC will be hosting a GGJ Play Party, where YOU will play and rate some of the 2300 games created by 11k participants at 244 sites world wide.  We'll also have quick post-mortems for the local projects.  <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/global-game-jam-2012/">Details about the local games are here!</a></p>
<p>Game on!<br />
