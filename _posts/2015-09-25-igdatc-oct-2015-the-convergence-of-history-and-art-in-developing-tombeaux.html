<p dir="ltr"><strong>Member Project: Meet the UW - Stout IGDA</strong></p>
<p>In the last five years the <a href="http://www.stoutigda.com/" rel="nofollow">UW - Stout IGDA</a> has hosted multiple game jams and speakers. With a new executive board this year, they are taking this opportunity to tell us about their past activity, current situation, and future plans. This presentation will include an interactive portion to sollicite ideas and suggestions from the audience.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Main Presentation: Halfway Mark Report: The Convergence of History and Art in Developing Tombeaux </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Dave Beck will share a "mid-mortem" experience about developing Tombeaux, a first-person narrative, historical walking simulator that is set on the St. Croix River. Beck will speak about how the game's creation has incorporated artistic, historical, and local elements that might not always be found in the game development process.</p>
