<h2>IGDATC August 2013 Meeting Announcement.  <a title="IGDATC August 2013 Meeting" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7612807111">Please Register at Eventbrite.</a></h2>
<p><strong>Shooting Fish in a Barrel - Mobile App Postmortems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chip Pedersen -  <a href="http://www.goldengearconsulting.com/">Golden Gear Consulting</a> and <a href="http://www.frostbitstudio.com/">FrostBit Studio</a></strong></p>
<p>18 year Game industry veteran Chip Pedersen speaks openly about transitioning his console studio to a mobile studio and the 3 apps they created for Bass Pro Shops.</p>
<p>He thought would it would be a great move for the studio. Hunting and fishing games were a popular genre in the App Store already. Combine that with a billion dollar license with huge marketing potential = Hit App. It should have been easy money, right?  It wasn't</p>
<p>This is a cautionary tale designed to help other developers think about their app design, development and marketing effort. Chip will save plenty of time for questions or if you want a private 1:1, buy him a beer.</p>

<p>A Humble Attempt By Two Friends To Build a Whimsical Strategy Game (How Garden Gnomes made it into the Apple App Store)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Rademacher and Jay Haase of <a href="http://www.lostlamppost.com/">Lost Lamppost </a>will describe the crazy road from idea to app store. Come to find out answers to these questions and more: Will they meet their goals? Will they find the missing artists? What is a whimsical strategy game anyway? Who stole the documentation for the Game Center API?<br />
