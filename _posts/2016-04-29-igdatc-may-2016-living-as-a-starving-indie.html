Covering the creation of <a href="http://nevenga.com/">Nevenga Games</a> and the sometimes hilarious/tragic bumbling events of the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spellbound Potions, the over zealous first game now being kickstarted!</li>
<li>Pinyo Project, the "simple" facebook game that wasn't so "simple".</li>
<li>and multiple RPG atempts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn from Brent's experiences and mistakes to avoid cost and wasted time.</p>
