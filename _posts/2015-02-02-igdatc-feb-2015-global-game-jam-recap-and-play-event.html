<p><strong>Global Game Jam Recap and Play Event<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location change notice</strong>: this meeting will be at <strong>UMN Rapson Hall Courtyard</strong>, the same location as GameCraft, the Global Game Jam site for IGDATC and Glitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/gamecraft-umn-glitch-and-igdatc/games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Our jam site produced 28</a> games during the jam! Come see, talk about and play some the games we made in January during the Global Game Jam. We'll talk about the jam and how things went. Some teams will get a few minutes to talk about their game and their jam expereince. What went wrong, what went right? Learned lessons and fun happenings. A great way to recap the Global Game Jam and see what eveyone spent their 48 hours on.</p>
<p>But most importantly, we've got the space this year to setup game stations so you can play the games. Including a few VR games and the game made by the <a href="http://vr.design.umn.edu/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Reality Design Lab (VRDL)</a> using their Perception Head-Mounted Display and motion capture system in Rapson Hall.</p>
