<h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>About Multiplayer Extravaganza</strong></h3>
<p><em>Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public.  All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).</em></p>
<p>Come out to this monthly(ish) bar event to play games and share gaming experiences! The games we will play and discuss include a rotating collection of multiplayer favorites suggested by the community as well as <strong>locally made games</strong> that local creators bring to the events. <strong>It's kind of like playing games on a couch with your friends, but bigger!</strong></p>
<h3>Fun Multiplayer Games for Everyone!</h3>
<p>We have multiple screens setup where we can play great games together at the same time! Games like <a href="http://www.deepdarkhole.com/elbowroom/">Elbow Room</a>! This event is for everybody, even people who claim they "don't play games."  Often times we are trying out new games, and everybody is equally terrible!  It is good fun.</p>
<h3>Locally Made Games</h3>
<p>We want to encourage local game makers to show off their own current projects.  Sign up for the <strong>"bring a game"</strong> ticket type, and we'll contact you with details.  This is a very friendly and helpful opportunity to do playtesting or just get general encouragement.</p>
<p>We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers.  Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a videogame, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>See you at Republic!</strong></h3>
<p>Join us at <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/">Republic (Seven Corners)</a> for an awesome time!  The festivities begin at <strong>6:30pm on Thursday, November 19th</strong> and go late.  Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight!  The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.</p>
<p>All of our volunteers and event attendees are asked to please read our <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/safe-arcade-policy/">Safe Arcade Policy</a>.</p>
<p>More info and further discussion can be found on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/igda-tc">IGDA-TC google group</a>.</p>
