<p>Thank you to everyone who came out to the IGDATC meeting lastÂ week! It was great to have such an amazing audience and hear all of the wonderful feedback. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kdszafranski/igdatc-this-indie-life-lessons-from-the-front-by-kris-szafranski-34868319">I've published the slide deck along with talk notes</a>.</p>

<p>A few notes about the Kickstarter portion, as I think that was one of the most well-liked topics. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/481479629/a-druids-duel-whimsical-turn-based-strategy">campaign page is still up on Kickstarter</a>. It looked quite a bit different at the end compared to the beginning. For those interested in the stats, <a href="http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/481479629/a-druids-duel-whimsical-turn-based-strategy/">Kicktraq is up as well</a>.</p>
<p>Drop me a line with any questions or comments you may have.</p>
