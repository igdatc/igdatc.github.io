<h3><strong>Winter Party Instead of Presentations</strong></h3>
<p><em>Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public.  All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).</em></p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be having our regular main IGDA-TC meeting at the Nerdery in December. Instead, come to <strong>Republic Seven Corners</strong> to hang out and relax at our casual winter social!  We'll have some video games and board games to play, of course.  Feel free to bring your own!  We know it is a busy time of the year for everybody, so please feel welcome to stop by any time during the night.  We'll be chilling and talking until they kick us out.</p>
<h3><strong>See you at Republic!</strong></h3>
<p>Join us at <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/">Republic (Seven Corners)</a> for an awesome time!  The festivities begin at <strong>6:00pm on Wednesday, December 16th</strong> and go late.  Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight!  The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.</p>
<p>All of our volunteers and event attendees are asked to please read our <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/safe-arcade-policy/">Safe Arcade Policy</a>.</p>
<p>More info and further discussion can be found on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/igda-tc">IGDA-TC google group</a>.</p>
