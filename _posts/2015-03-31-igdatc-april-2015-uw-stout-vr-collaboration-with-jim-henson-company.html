<p><strong>UW-Stout VR Collaboration with Jim Henson Company</strong></p>
<p>Students from the University of Wisconsin-Stout’s Game Design BFA will present projects resulting from collaboration with the Jim Henson Company to create games inspired by the Farscape Universe. Two teams of eight used Maya and Unity to create 3D environments to be experienced with the Oculus Rift DK2 headsets.  After working for two intense weeks, the 16 students flew out to Los Angeles to pitch their projects to the Jim Henson Company, and tour various game and animation studios.  The presentation will both serve as a pitch for the game, as well as a play test session with the VR headsets.</p>
