<p><strong>VR and <a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/" rel="nofollow">Google Cardboard</a> Crash Course - Paul Christian and Zach Wendt</strong></p>
<p>Creating your first VR app can be suprisingly fast, easy, and cheap. But, there's definitely pitfalls along the way. We'll get you started out in the right direction!</p>
<p>Zach will give a quick and broad overview of important VR design considerations, and the hardware and human perception factors behind them. Paul will give a tutorial on Google Cardboard development in Unity, and some features of the Cardboard app he made for<a href="http://toursler.com/" rel="nofollow">Toursler</a>. The talk will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary of VR "tiers" - hardware and experiences</li>
<li>Overview of relevant human perception factors, with fun illusions</li>
<li>VR design Do's, Don'ts, and painful mistakes</li>
<li>Cardboard viewer differences</li>
<li>Deciding between the Cardboard SDK for Android, and SDK for Unity</li>
<li>Build and Deploy a sample Unity project for Google Cardboard</li>
<li>Leveraging Unity scripting to pull data from the internet in real time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oculus Connect 2 (oc2) Summary - Various</strong></p>
<p>The second annual Oculus Connect conference is Sept 23-25th. It should be just as jam packed with great info as last year. Check out last years talks for a flavor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=addUnJpjjv4" rel="nofollow">Tom Forsyth's talk</a>was my favorite.</p>
<p>Since Oculus <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/announcing-oculus-connect-2-schedule-talks-and-speakers/" rel="nofollow">will be livestreaming</a> and putting all talks online after, we'll just have informal recaps from attendees - favorite stories, demos, new knowledge and celebrity encounters.  We have at least 3 people from MN going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
