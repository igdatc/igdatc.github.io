Multiple games will be presented by representatives from teams of artists, designers, and programmers. While the games are not finished *yet*, this will be a perfect chance to get a sneak peek into the development processes behind these games, before they are debuted a month later at the Stout Game Launch from 6-8pm on Wednesday, April 27th in Menomonie (only 60 minutes from the Twin Cities!). For more information, please visit <a title="UW Stout Game Design Program" href="http://www.uwstout.edu/gamedesign.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UW-Stout's Game Design Program</a> web site.</p>
