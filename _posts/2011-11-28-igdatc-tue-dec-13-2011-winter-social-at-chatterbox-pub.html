<p>Join IGDATC for our winter social in the banquet room at the Chatterbox Pub St. Paul. Drop by any time for happy hour, dinner, or evening entertainment.</p>
<p>Expect folks to stay past 10. Happy hour is 2-5 and 10-12.</p>
<p>We're setting up in the banquet room at 4pm with some great arcade games on real arcade controls, a Kinect with the best of the new games, and a lonely 3DS with Mario Kart 7. Bring your 3DS for link and download play, card or board games, or anything else you'd like to share.</p>
<p>If you've never been to the Chatterbox Pub, they're known for free board games, cheap Atari, NES and Sega rentals on retro TVs and couches, and great microbrew beer, homemade ginger ale and root beer.</p>
