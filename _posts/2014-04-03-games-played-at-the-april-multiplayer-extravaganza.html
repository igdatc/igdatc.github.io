<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-384" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_0041-cropped-598x269.jpg" alt="DSC_0041-cropped" width="598" height="269" />Last night's <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/2014/03/april-2-2014-igdatc-and-glitch-mixer-and-multiplayer-extravaganza/">Multiplayer Extravaganza</a> went off without a hitch, and everyone seemed to have a blast playing all the various games that we had on display.</p>
<p>A ton of great indie developers sent us builds of their games for us to check out, and this post is just one way of saying thanks for that generosity. In alphabetical order, we had on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.powerhoof.com/crawl/">Crawl</a> by Powerhoof -- This dungeon crawler got a lot of attention, partly because you can play it for hours. Super fun concept, and definitely a blast to play.</li>
<li><a href="http://field1game.com/">Field-1</a> -- I personally couldn't get enough of this game that describes itself as "like playing hockey inside a pinball machine".</li>
<li><a href="http://www.asteroidbase.com/dangerous-spacetime/">Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</a> by Asteroid Base -- It's safe to say that this game drew onlookers and admirers from all over.</li>
<li><em>One Spear</em> by 36peas -- We got a sneak peek at the mac/pc version of this game already <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/one-spear-arena/id787165583?mt=8">out for iOS</a></li>
<li><em>Particle Mace</em> by Andy Wallace -- A super-fun retro arcade style game. It's got a single player mode that I will be checking out in the near future, and is available now on the <a href="http://particlemace.com/">Particle Mace website</a> in a "pre-alpha" (but perfectly playable) state for purchase.</li>
<li><em>Protoboros</em> by <a href="http://www.zachstronaut.com">Zachary Johnson</a> -- Zach's multiplayer snake game from the 2012 GGJ had us hot on each other's heels.</li>
<li><em>SlashDash</em> by <a href="http://nevernautgames.com/">Nevernaut Games</a> -- Capture the flag doesn't begin to explain how fun this game is.</li>
</ul>
<p>We had three other screens, one playing <em>Towerfall: Ascension</em> on a PS4, another hooked up to an Xbox 360, where both <em>Speedrunners</em> and <em>Hidden in Plain Sight</em> were played, as well as one playing some steam favorites like <em>Samurai Gun</em> and <em>Gang Beasts</em>. Though it was advertised, I don't think <em>Starwhal</em> got any playtime. There's always next month.</p>
<p>One of the Glitch folks brought a prototype card game that got played at least once, with the designer sitting on taking notes.</p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://glitch.mn/">Glitch</a> organizers and IGDATC organizers for putting the event together! Thanks to Hollie Figueroa for taking the photo used in this post. And thanks to everyone who showed up and played the games! Let me know in the comments if I missed mentioning any games that were played!</p>
