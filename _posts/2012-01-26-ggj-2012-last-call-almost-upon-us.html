<p>We got the details worked out for the Global Game Jam event at The Nerdery. If you want in there is still time. Registration must be complete by Friday at 12:00PM (noon). Make sure you are signed up by then if you want to partake in the event. Sign-up is free and so is access to our sponsored location.</p>
<p>Another big update is that we will be driving this event through all 48 hours. The Nerdery will remain open the whole time so feel free to sleep there both nights (if you end up sleeping).</p>
<p>For far more details, schedule of events, or all the details of the freebies offered to competition goers check out our location page on the GGJ site right here:</p>

<p>Remember, if you want to join us just create an account on the Global Game Jam site (free) and set the IGDATC as your location. Also make sure to fill out the profile as complete as you can so we know what skill sets we have coming to the event.</p>
