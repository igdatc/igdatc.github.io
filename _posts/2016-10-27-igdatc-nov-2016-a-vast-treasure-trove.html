</strong></b><b><strong>Story Time with Zachary Johnson</strong></b></p>
<p>Gather round for story time with Zachary Johnson. This time, there will be travel tales from Fantastic Arcade, Pixel Pop, and IndieCade. The thick is guaranteed to plotten with news of NESpectre and Joggernauts.  And stay tuned for a big reveal involving Tommy Sunders, Robert Frost, and a mace from outer space!  Anything could happen.</p>

<p><b><strong>A Vast Treasure Trove<br />
Patrick Leder</strong></b></p>
<p>From its early days as a modest work in progress to a success, Vast has gone through many changes. As a board game designer Patrick faces a unique set of challenges. He will discuss transparency in design, flow, and play balance, in terms of the development of Vast. In addition, he’ll talk about the technical process of creating a game and all of the people involved.</p>
<p>Patrick Leder runs <a href="http://ledergames.com/">Leder Games</a>, a Board games micro-publisher that makes exciting, socially conscious games. They've published the rummy style card game Trick or Treat, and their newest title is Vast, the ultimate asymmetric cave-crawler board game. Sometimes working on Vast full time, Patrick is currently working part time in the Hennepin county Public Defender IT office doing help desk and development work as needed.</p>
