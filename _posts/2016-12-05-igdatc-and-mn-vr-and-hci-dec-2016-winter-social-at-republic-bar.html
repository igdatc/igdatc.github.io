<p><strong>Winter Party Instead of Presentations</strong></p>
<p>We will not be having our regular meetings in December. Instead, come to Republic Seven Corners to hang out and relax at our casual winter social! We'll have some video games and board games to play, of course. Feel free to bring your own! We know it is a busy time of the year for everybody, so please feel welcome to stop by any time during the night. We'll be chilling and talking until they kick us out.</p>
