Dev Jana - DevNAri</strong></b></p>
<p>Newt One is a truly non-violent 3D platformer currently in "mid-beta" by Minneapolis 2-man crewÂ <a href="http://devnari.com/">DevNAri</a>. This talk will dive into the evolution of the distinct art style, adaptive music/sound effects systems, and other systems in the game including their implementation and design. Also front and center in this talk will be the ability to make decisions and change direction as needed when working independently.</p>
<p>Co-owners of DevNAri LLC, Ari Carrillo ("President of Visuals and Playtime", 3D Modeler at Axonom Inc.) and Dev Jana ("President of Code and Noise", newly relocated back to the Twin Cities to be an instructor at Prime Digital Academy) have been working on Newt One since Jan 1st 2015 on the nights/weekends and are looking forward to releasing Newt one by year's end.</p>
