<p><strong>What's it's really like to work in Game industry - Chip Pedersen</strong></p>
<p>"You get paid to play games all day?" Everyone thinks the video game industry is just fun and games. I'm here to tell you it's not. It complex software development and problem solving with a twist. Not only do you have to make a solid software program, on time, on budget. You also have to make sure its fun. Building games is hard enough. Building a game that is fun and makes money is even harder.</p>
<p>Discover all the different positions that have to come together to make a hit video game. Learn the differences of working at AAA publisher, a developer to a startup indie studio. The highs, the lows, the late nights, where we harvest unicorn tears and lots of caffeine. Did I mention caffeine? Over my 20 years in video games I have seen it all, and lived to talk about. Please come with questions, prepared to laugh and learn why we don't get paid to play games all day.</p>
<p>Chip Pedersen currently works at <a href="http://www.concretesoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Concrete Software</a> and runs his own studio <a href="http://www.frostbitstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FrostBit Studio</a>.</p>
