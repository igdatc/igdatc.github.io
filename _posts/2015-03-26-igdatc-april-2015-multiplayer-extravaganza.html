<h3><strong>Multiplayer Extravaganza</strong></h3>
<p>The Multiplayer Extravaganza is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of multiplayer favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local creators bring to the events. <strong>It's kind of like playing games on a couch with your friends, but bigger!</strong></p>
<p>Come share your passion for games, or sign up to show your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world. Join us at <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/">Republic (Seven Corners)</a> for good friends, games to play, and general fun!  The festivities begin at <strong>6:30pm on Thursday, April 2</strong> and go late.  Republic has a late night happy hour from 10 - midnight!  The food is excellent, and they have a huge beer list.</p>
<p><strong>Like all IGDA-TC events, this is free and open to the public.  All ages welcome (under 18 with parent or guardian).</strong></p>
<h3>Locally Made Games</h3>
<p>We want to encourage local game makers to show off their own current projects.  Sign up for the <strong>"bring a game"</strong> ticket type, and we'll contact you with details.  This is a very friendly and helpful opportunity to do playtesting or just get general encouragement.</p>
<p>We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers.  Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a videogame, etc.</p>
<p><strong>See you at Republic for the fun!</strong></p>
