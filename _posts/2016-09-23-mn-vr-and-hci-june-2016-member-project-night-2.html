<p><strong>MN VR and HCI Member Project Night 2016</strong></p>
<p>A lot of new projects and/or new members have been appearing at meetings recently. So, we thought it would be fun to get a quick show and tell on as wide a variety of projects as possible (Not only VR, not only games, etc.)</p>
<p>Presentations will be fast (5-10 min timed), and informal - with some type of visuals being mandatory. Recently completed projects, incomplete/WIP, interesting graphics, shaders or HCI experiments are all encouraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's who's confirmed so far. Grab a Presenter ticket, and we'll add you to this list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tony Bruno - </strong>Enterprise Constitution Class for Vive</li>
<li><strong>Paul Christian -</strong> Simple Stereo Drone Video / Thom Yorke's Face</li>
<li><strong>Paul Eckhardt -</strong> Beach Ball Vally / Zen Blade / Space Couch!</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Foss -</strong> It Puts the Ball in the Basket for Vive</li>
<li><strong>Martin Grider -</strong> Puzzle Prison: a VR puzzle game for PC and mobile</li>
<li><strong>Paul Lyrek - </strong>Sparky's Day - Educational Museum Experience</li>
<li><strong>Mike Medicinehorse -</strong> Trip to the Moon / VR for a convention</li>
<li><strong>Zach Wendt -</strong> Trampoline VR / 4 Vive controller experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parking:</strong></p>
<p>There is nearby street parking and surface lots.  Parking right in front of Vidku costs more.  Try the lots at 1st and Washington (both sides of Pixel Farm), and 3rd and Hennepin (behind Vidku.)  Bring cash.  Small bills.  Unmarked.</p>

<p><strong>Presenter Notes:</strong></p>
<p>The Vidku projector has a full-size HDMI only for input for video and audio.  You're encouraged to put slides, pics or video online - then use the shared PC laptop running chrome.  No thumb drives please.  Video doesn't need to be great/captured - use your phone.</p>
<p>Talks will be strictly timed.  Plan for a 5-7 minute presentation max, including setup.  Previous presenter will do Q&amp;A while you set up.  Run through your presentation once with a clock - don't be like Zach :)</p>
<p><strong>If you find yourself wanting to show more stuff, we're always looking for presenters for our regular format. Do both!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plug My Thing!</strong></p>
<p>In addition to informal verbal plugs, we'll also show your trailer, user group, recruitment page, promo video, personal project, demo reel, etc. Grab the appropriate ticket - first come, first served.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Short and sweet.</strong> 3 minutes max!  You will be timed.<br />
<strong>1 short URL,</strong> Zero setup (any media on reliable site like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)<br />
<strong>Your contact info</strong> is on the page or in the video.<br />
<strong>You were a part</strong> of this project, are attending the meeting, and will introduce it.<br />
<strong>Check in</strong> 5-10 minutes early, so we can load your page</p>
