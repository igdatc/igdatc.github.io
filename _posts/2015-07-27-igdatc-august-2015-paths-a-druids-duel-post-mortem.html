<p><strong>Paths: A Druid’s Duel Post-mortem</strong></p>
<p>It’s no secret that game development involves a multitude of difficult decisions from game inception to final release. Every step you take alters your view and affects latter choices. Only upon review can we see the path for what it was and determine just how good (or bad) our decisions may have been.</p>
<p>Join Kris Szafranski for an honest review of the development and launch of <a title="A Druid's Duel Website" href="http://www.druidsduel.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Druid’s Duel</a>, a turn-based strategy game released on Steam in February 2015.</p>
<p>In this talk we'll dissect the development and business decisions made and their outcomes around common game development concerns: Game Design, Architecture, Project Management, Marketing/PR, and Community Management.</p>
<p>Kris Szafranski is the owner of <a title="Thought Shelter Games Website" href="http://www.druidsduel.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thoughtshelter Games</a>, where he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and then launched the game <a title="A Druid's Duel Website" href="http://www.druidsduel.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Druid’s Duel</a> on Steam in early 2015.<br />
<strong>A Developer's Journey</strong></p>
<p>In April, Nik Olson released a game called <a title="Gravity Lines Website" href="http://pizzascripters.com/gravitylines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Lines</a> on <a title="iOS Gravity Lines Lite" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gravity-lines-lite/id979065089?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>, <a title="Android Gravity Lines Lite" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pizzascripters.gravitylines.android&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a title="Play Gravity Lines in browser" href="http://pizzascripters.com/gravitylines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">browser</a>. Nik was 12 years old. As a young game developer Nik has accomplished a lot and he's going to tell us all about it. Nik will talk about his background and how he found help and developed his skills. He'll walk through <a title="Gravity Lines Website" href="http://pizzascripters.com/gravitylines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Lines</a>, from the idea and development to making the music and publishing. What's next?</p>
<p>Nik Olson is a 13 year old game developer. He created Gravity Lines, and founded the After School Programming Club called <a title="Pizza Scripters" href="http://pizzascripters.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pizza Scripters</a> at Harriet Bishop Elementary School.</p>
