<p><strong>Victory Motorcycles VR experience: Marc Jensen - space150</strong></p>
<p>space150 recently partnered with Victory Motorcycles (Polaris Industries) to create a first-of-its-kind virtual reality ride that transported Chicago International Motorcycle Show attendees to Sturgis—through the Badlands and Needles of South Dakota.</p>
<p>This talk will be a deep dive covering all aspects of the project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early VR R&amp;D work at spaceLab</li>
<li>Guided vs direct user controls</li>
<li>Tricks for representing the Virtual Self</li>
<li>Passive and active haptics</li>
<li>Experience design for first-time VR users</li>
<li>VR exhibiting tips for tradeshows</li>
</ul>
