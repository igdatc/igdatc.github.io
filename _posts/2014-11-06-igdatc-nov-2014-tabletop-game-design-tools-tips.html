<p><strong>Tabletop Game Design Tools and Tips - Martin Grider</strong></p>
<p>Martin Grider will talk about his experiences designing a fairly complex tabletop game over the course of several years.

He'll also discuss and demonstrate Playtest, a tool for converting spreadsheet data to printable playing card prototypes.</p>
