<h3>Multiplayer Extravaganza!</h3>
<p>IGDA Twin Cities is proud to present another Multiplayer Extravaganza!</p>
<p>The Multiplayer Extravaganza is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local creators bring to the events. Come share your passion for games, or sign up to show your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world.</p>
<p>As usual, we're coordinating with a number of local game developers and hope to have an awesome selection of local games to play!  We're interested in all kinds of games made by local developers.  Your game can be a rough demo or a finished product, single player or multiplayer, a board game or a video game, etc.  If you'd like to show your game, please select the "I'll attend and want to bring a game I made!" ticket type when registering for the event.</p>
<p>All of our events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>This month we're experimenting with a new location, <a href="http://www.republicmn.com/">Republic</a> in "Seven Corners", near the West Bank of the UofMN. Republic has excellent food, and A LOT of beers on tap.</p>
<p>There are parking ramps and lots near the bar, as well as some metered parking on the street.</p>
