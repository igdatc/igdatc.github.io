<p>Did you know a gaming group for local IGDATC gamers has started?  Ryan Schaefer has been volunteered to manage it.  He posted the following to the mailing list, but we're posting it here as well for all to see.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In an effort to promote fun and enjoyment amongst this group, I have now usurped control of the IGDATC Steam group.</em></p>
<p><em>What does this mean? It means we can very easily use Steam to organize games and have fun! Who doesn't love fun?</em></p>
<p><em>If you'd like to be a part of this journey into gaming goodness, join our steam group at  <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IDGATC">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IDGATC</a>. This steam group gives us a group page and allows us to schedule events, and view it's members. It's quite useful.</em></p>
<p><em>We also have a beautiful spreadsheet on Google Docs where we can easily see each other's ID's (Steam, XBox, PS3, other?) and current game fascinations: <a href="http://bit.ly/vHDZEL">http://bit.ly/vHDZEL</a> And let's be honest, who *doesn't* love spreadsheets? Feel free to add yourself and your info to the list!</em></p>
<p><em>If you'd like to join us for entertaining gaming shenanigans, but don't have Steam or a PC, you can send a friend invite to the IGDATC Xbox Live account. &lt;<a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamertag=IGDATC">http://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamertag=IGDATC</a>&gt; This works in a similar manner to the steam group, only without the ability to schedule stuff. It also has 10 gamerpoints, so you know it's serious!</em></p>
<p><em>In closing, we should play some games, because games are fun! -- Ryan Schaefer &lt;<a href="http://ryanschaefer.yolasite.com/">http://ryanschaefer.yolasite.com/</a>&gt; @Digitalistic</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, although it is short notice, this Thursday (Dec. 7th), he's hosting a multiplayer Terraria server.  Join the steam group for more details.  Terraria is a blast!</p>
