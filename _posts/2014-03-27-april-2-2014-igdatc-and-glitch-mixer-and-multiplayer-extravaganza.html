Welcome cybernauts! Please join us.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer Extravaganza!</h3>
<p>We'll once again be chatting, eating, drinking and most importantly playing and shouting at the greatest in shared-screen multiplayer games, but this time on 4 screens and platforms at once.</p>
<p>We're bringing back the crowd pleasers <strong>Starwahl, Samurai Gunn and Gang Beasts.</strong></p>
<p>We'll be adding <strong>Towerfall, SpeedRunners, Hidden in Plain Sight,</strong> and testing a few more.</p>
<p>Buffalo Wild Wings has a small attached parking lot, and street/ramp parking near by. Happy hour is until 6:30.</p>
