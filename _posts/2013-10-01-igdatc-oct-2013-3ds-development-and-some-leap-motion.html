<h2><strong>3DS Development and some Leap Motion<br />
</strong><strong>Ken Patterson, Matt Heinzen, AJ Boganey and Ryan Appel from <a href="http://www.bigjohngames.com/">Big John Games</a></strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/8523823987">Please Register at Eventbrite</a></h3>
<p>Big John Games will discuss it's 2013 releases of "Big Bass Arcade: No Limit" and "Smash Bowling 3D" on the Nintendo 3DS. We're also distributing our 3DS games in Japan and Europe, and will review the hurdles involved in that accomplishment.</p>
<p>BJG is about to launch it's latest game "Ohno Odyssey" for 3DS. We will present a developer discussion of what went into the design and development of this unique new game.</p>
<p>We'll also show and discuss <a href="https://airspace.leapmotion.com/apps/catch-up-calu/osx">Catch Up Calu!</a>, a PC / Mac game BJG developed for Stutzwerks.  It was designed around the Leap Motion controller, and built in Unity.</p>
<p>As usual questions are welcomed and encouraged.</p>

<p>Apportable is a toolchain and set of libraries that allow you to cross compile native iOS code for Android with minimal fuss. We have been working to port a number of unreleased iOS games to Android using Apportable, and so far the experience has been surprisingly smooth.</p>
