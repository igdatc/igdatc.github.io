<p>Seems we actually ran our of tickets for the event this time. This of course wasn't really the case and we have fixed the problem by adding more tickets. Good news is we hit the original 70 ticket limit originally. We are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Please make sure to register before 4PM tomorrow for pizza counts. The last thing we need is a nerd mob incited by lack of pizza and beer. God help us all if that happens. See you there.</p>
