<p>October is a huge month for VR with launches of PSVR, Google Daydream and Oculus Touch, and also several big conferences.  We'll blast through the big announcements, videos, new hardware and demo impressions and favorite stories from each - with a strict 20 minute countdown timer for each topic/discussion.  Extended conversations encouraged at the bar afterwards.  All sections are covered, but we'd still like to add a couple different viewpoints.</p>
