<p><strong>Mixed Reality Video Production</strong></p>
<p>How do yo show Virtual Reality to someone who’s never experienced it? MR becoming a very popular way to sell VR, but there’s still a major lack of tools. Learn about Pixel Farm’s early experiments and new/upcoming techniques looking to make MR more accessible to developers and streamers.</p>
