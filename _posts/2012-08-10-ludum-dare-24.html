<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> is a regular accelerated game development Event. Participants develop games from scratch in a weekend, based on a theme suggested by community. Ludum Dare #24 is this month, starting August 24th, 2012.</p>
<p>We've heard some interest from the community in the past, which has developed into at least one organized event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canopyco.com/">Canopy</a> has graciously offered to host a Ludum Dare 24 jam, starting 6pm Fri to 10pm Sun. The site will be open overnight. There are a variety of food choices within walking distance. Canopy is located at 615 First Avenue NE, Suite 425, Minneapolis, MN 55413. If interested in the group jam, please contact Joel Stewart for info and updates. joel@canopyco.com @ojstewart</p>
<p>Additionally, The IGDATC would like to promote the activities of local developers by suggesting they use our <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/mailing-list/">mailing list</a> as a way to find others participating locally. Contact us and our followers via twitter, @igdatc or on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/IGDATC">Facebook</a> page.</p>
