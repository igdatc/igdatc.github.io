<p dir="ltr"><strong>Member Project: Let's Talk About Contracts Baby</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot involved with making and publishing a game. Contracts are incredibly important and are commonly overlooked. What are contracts? What are they for? Do I need one? When should I have one in place? What should they cover? Contracts can be involved and confusing. Kris Szafranski has had experience with contracts and will address some of these questions. Most importantly, lessons learned and what to look out for.</p>
<p>Kris Szafranski is the owner of <a title="Thoughtshelter Games" href="http://www.thoughtshelter.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thoughtshelter Games</a>, where he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and then launched the game <a title="A Druid's Duel" href="http://www.thoughtshelter.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Druid's Duel</a> on <a title="A Druid's Duel on Steam" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/333970/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> in early 2015. *Kris is NOT a lawer.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Main Presentation: Taking Your Game Global</strong></p>
<p>It's hard enough to get a brand new indie game noticed in the domestic market, let alone in other places around the world. This month, Michael Migliacio of Intropy Games will be discussing a few tips and tricks he learned while exhibiting the PC and Wii U action puzzle game, Astral Breakers, as a part of the 2015 Tokyo Game Show Indie Showcase in Japan. Learn how to shatter language and cultural barriers alike and find a brand new audience for your game!</p>
