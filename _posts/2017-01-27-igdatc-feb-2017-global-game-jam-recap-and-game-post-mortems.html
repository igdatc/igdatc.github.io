<p><b><strong>Global Game Jam Recap and Game Post-mortems</strong></b></p>
<p>GameCraft, the Global Game Jam 2017, was a smashing success with <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2017/jam-sites/gamecraft-university-minnesota-twin-cities-2017/games">31 games submitted on our jam site</a>. With the 2017 Global Game Jam still fresh in our minds, come join us for a review discussion and post-mortems. Some teams will talk about their game and their jam experience. What went wrong, what went right? Learned lessons and fun happenings. A great way to recap the Global Game Jam and see what everyone spent their 48 hours on.</p>

<p>If you participated in the jam and would like to talk about your game during the meeting, please register for the "I'll talk about my game" ticket.</p>
<p>Due to the number of games and limited time and space, this is not a play event. Glitch is hosting a Gamecraft games play event called <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/play-party-gamecraft-tickets-31445064033">PLAY PARTY</a>.
