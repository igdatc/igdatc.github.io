<p>The IGDATC has confirmed a site for the 2012 Global Game Jam. The Nerdery has confirmed that they will house our event starting at 4:00pm on Friday the 27th and we will go to 4:00pm on Sunday the 29th. There is still a bit of TBD as to whether we will be able to be there overnight from Saturday to Sunday. If we can't they will close Saturday at 11:00pm and open again on Sunday at 9:00am. Again, we will get a final word on this before the event.</p>
<p>The full details and registration will be up by Friday. We still have to get the final confirmation that the site is official from the GGJ people. Until then you can <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/user/register" target="_blank">sign-up early</a> for a GGJ account and fill in your location when we get the notice that it is live.</p>
<p>Make sure to check back throughout the week to stay up to date with all the details.</p>
<p>So as a summary, tentative schedule (more detailed in the coming days) is as follows:</p>
<p>Starts Friday (1/27) - 4:00PM<br />
Possibly closed Saturday 11:00PM - Sunday 9:00PM<br />
Event Ends Sunday (1/29) - 4:00PM</p>
