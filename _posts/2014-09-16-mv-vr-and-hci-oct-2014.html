<p><strong><a href="https://www.oculusvr.com/connect/" rel="nofollow">Oculus Connect</a>  Recap by Chris Johnson - <a href="http://www.dualrealitygames.com/" rel="nofollow">Dual Reality Games</a></strong></p>
<p>The Oculus Connect conference is 9/19 - 9/20, and looks to be jam packed with detailed technical, design and physiological info.  Check <a href="https://www.oculusvr.com/connect/" rel="nofollow">the schedule</a> for details.  Or as Palmer put it <em>"I heard a rumor that it is going to be very developer centric, not a public relations and press hub like most company-run events. Announcements will revolve around things that are relevant to existing VR developers, not the general public." </em></p>
<p><strong>DK2 Features and Troubleshooting - Zach Wendt</strong></p>
<p>The Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 is hugely improved, and it's greatly reduced my sim sickness.  But, it also has tough performance requirements, hardware compatibility issues, and a very young SDK - any of which can trigger the dreaded "judder" effect.  This will be a quick overview of all the new hardware, sensors and SDK features, an in-depth discussion of Timewarp, and some performance tips and troubleshooting advice  ...for PC, Mac expertise very welcome.</p>
<p>I will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>OLED display pros/cons</li>
<li>Panel overdrive</li>
<li>75hz and low persistence mode</li>
<li>Rift "Direct Mode" device driver pros/cons</li>
<li>Timewarp in depth</li>
<li>Preview of asynchronous timewarp (like Note 4 / Gear VR)</li>
<li>New frame pipeline, render targets and performance changes</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm planning on showing video examples.  <strong>Please get in touch if you have a portable computer than can drive a DK2 with all features working well AND mirror to a projector.   </strong>It's valuable info even if you can't be there.</p>
