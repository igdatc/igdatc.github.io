</strong></b><b><strong>Verdant Skies Development Update</strong></b></p>
<p>Verdant Skies grew out of a love for games like Harvest Moon and a desire create something special with modern gameplay and deep storytelling. We'll hear some development highlights from the team. <a href="https://twitter.com/kortham" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://twitter.com/kortham&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475692857793000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFohwHD7_tJ25qBQp4xmCbNFgqgGA">Andy Korth</a> will give a programming update. <a href="http://www.yellowchordaudio.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.yellowchordaudio.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475692857793000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5Z2HSYSuX4QxiKIyScKpxtoKy5w">Troy Strand, and Topher Pirkl</a> will talk about music and sound design.

<p><b><strong>All Your Crates Are Belong To Us<br />
Dev Jana</strong></b></p>
<p>Through the lenses of modern expectations of games, flow state, and foundational game design principles, we'll explore the challenges of moving games into the future while attempting to not alienate the general public. All while keeping the industry's dedicated fanbase from spinning into boredom. This participatory session will include real world examples as well as a classic game case study from the 8-Bit era that stands out as a terminal endpoint for a game genre.</p>
<p>The last decade or so has seen Dev making and teaching games, interactive web projects, and mobile apps across the US. Currently an Instructor at Prime Digital Academy and President of Code and Noises with Twin Cities based indie game manifesting DevNAri LLC, Dev has also taught Game Design and Development in numerous colleges across the US as well as being a speaker at events such as MinneBar, IndieCon (Burlington, VT), and the Independent Games Conference West (Los Angeles) and has previously presented his current project Newt One at IGDATC this past June.</p>
