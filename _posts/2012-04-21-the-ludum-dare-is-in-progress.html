<p>The Ludum Dare has begun and I have setup a chat line on IRC in case people want to hop on and discuss stuff. I unfortunately will not be entering this time as my weekend just got too full of stuff to do. If you want to chat just hop on an IRC client and connect to irc.synirc.net then join the channel #IGDATC.</p>
<p>The theme this time around is Tiny World. So run wild with it and let us know how things are going. Can't wait to see the results. Also don't forget there is a seperate Jam going on that gives you an extra day to work on the game. Good luck participants.</p>
