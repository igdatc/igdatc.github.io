<p><strong>Unity VR/AR Bootcamp and Tips - Various</strong></p>
<p>Just in time for GGJ... Learn how to create your first VR or AR Unity project using free software and content (now free on iOS too!) Then our panelists will share their favorite design, workflow, and code tips and lead a free-form discussion and Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>Zach Wendt will give a live demo of creating and deploying VR projects for Oculus Rift DK2, Google Cardboard (on Android) and Gear VR. Time/interest permitting, we'll also demo, or at least discuss Cardboard for iOS, and Project Tango. Zach will also give a quick overview/demo of input for VR and, designing for different hardware.</p>
<p>Then, our panelists will each share a few of their favorite design, workflow, and code tips for beginner to advanced skill levels. Their VR/AR experience covers almost all bases: Unity, UE4, Vive, Oculus, GearVR, Tango, iOS, hand tracking, networked VR, large scale tracking, avatar IK and animation, Blender, heavy geometry and optimization.</p>
<p>Our Panelists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Eckhardt</li>
<li>Ryan Foss</li>
<li>Thomas Myers</li>
<li>Zach Wendt</li>
<li>Aaron Westre</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we'll wrap with a round-table discussion / Q&amp;A. We'd like to talk about audience projects, roadblocks, and ideas. Bring some!</p>
