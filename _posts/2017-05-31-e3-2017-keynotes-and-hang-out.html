</a>Monday, June 12, 2017 from 2:30 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>IGDA Twin Cities and Glitch are hosting the 6th annual E3 Social at <a title="Glitch Website" href="http://glitch.mn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Glitch HQ</a> near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The conference schedule is more spread out than pervious years, so we're doing things a little differently. We'll watch the live press conferences from Ubisoft and Sony, and watch recorded press conferences between. Stop by any time. Bring your laptop and "work" (though space is limited), or just come to hang out, play some games, run some playtests, etc.</p>
<p>There isn't food or drink service, but you can bring your own food and drinks. Or plan to order in or go to a nearby restauraunt for dinner. You may bring your own drinks if you want (alcohol is ok so long as you're responsible and legal age).</p>
<p>Between 4 and 8 there are no live press conferences, so we'll watch other recorded press conferences, go out for food (or order in), or play games.</p>
<p>This event is open to all, no memberships required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
